                  working as a VISTA volunteer, chess director, and journalism instructor. Moving to
                  Hollywood, Martin worked in the television industry in roles such as a story
                  editor for The Twilight Zone and producer for Beauty and the Beast. Among the many
                  awards Martin has garnered are Hugo Awards for Best Novella, Best Novelette, Best
